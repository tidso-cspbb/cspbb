      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        The <i>Center for the Study of Photoemission and Bright Beams</i> (CSPBB) is a nonprofit research organization
        dedicated to advancing the scientific understanding of photoemission phenomena and the generation of ultra-bright electron beams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded by Truman W. Idso, CSPBB supports experimental and theoretical work in condensed matter physics,
        photoemission, and beam science, with applications ranging from particle accelerators to ultrafast electron microscopy and diffraction.
        We aim to promote and examine rigorous, transparent research in fundamental photoemission and beam science.
