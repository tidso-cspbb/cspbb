      <h2>About Us</h2>
      <p>
        The Center for the Study of Photoemission and Bright Beams (CSPBB) is a nonprofit research organization
        dedicated to advancing the scientific understanding of photoemission phenomena and the generation of ultra-bright electron beams.
      </p>
      <p>
        Founded by Truman W. Idso, CSPBB supports experimental and theoretical work in condensed matter physics,
        photoemission, and beam science, with applications ranging from particle accelerators to ultrafast electron microscopy/diffraction.
        Our mission is to promote and examine rigorous, transparent research in fundamental photoemission and beam science.
